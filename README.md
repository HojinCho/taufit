### Estimating the DRW timescale in AGN light curves using [celerite](https://github.com/dfm/celerite)

#### Author: [Colin J. Burke](https://astro.illinois.edu/directory/profile/colinjb2), University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

This repository is intended to be a simple resource for modeling AGN light curves using celerite-based gaussian processes. This code is easy to install and ~10x faster than carma_pack. Only a few lines of code are required to fit each light curve. This package is particularly useful for efficiently extracting the DRW timescale parameter Ï„_DRW:

```
fit_drw(x*u.day, y*u.mag, yerr*u.mag)
```
